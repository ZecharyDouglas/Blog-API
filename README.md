# Blog-API

## Description
This project creates an API using Express.js, Postgresql, and Sequelize to host user posts, user information, and comments. The Sequelize ORM provides an abstraction for interacting with three tables in the Database. The `server.js` file provides routes enabling full CRUD capability for the comments and posts tables, as well as user authentication by sign in, sign up, and logout.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to build a mock API that simulates a blog server, allowing users to create posts and make comments that can be on the posts or exist by themselves.

## Technologies Used
- Express.js
- bcryptjs
- nodemon server
- Postgresql
- Sequelize
